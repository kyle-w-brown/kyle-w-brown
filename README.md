## Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kyle and I'm the human version of dependabot. I'm an expert in outperforming benchmarks with open source technology across devices, automotive embedded systems, servers, and datacenters. 

I have clients across several industries and may be able to help solve your needs? Big or small.
